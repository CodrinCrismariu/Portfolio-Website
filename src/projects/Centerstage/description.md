## First Tech Challenge Centerstage Robot

This is the robot I designed along my highschool robotics team Peppers for the FTC Centerstage season. Qualified for national semi-finals and Maryland Tech Invitational international competition. The robot picked up hexagonal game elements and placed them on a backboard as efficiently as possible.

## Highlights

- Iterated entirely in Fusion 360, from mecanum chassis to intake, outtake, and climber modules
- Combined CNC-cut aluminum with FDM-printed components for lightweight, easily iterable assemblies
- Ran fully autonomous dead-wheel odometry fused with an IMU for turret auto-alignment and path following
- Active roller intake with IR sensing fed a cascading-slide outtake for rapid pixel scoring
- Shared-power elevator and climber achieved reliable sub-second hangs while preserving scoring speed
