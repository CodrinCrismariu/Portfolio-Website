Built for the 2021–2022 FTC Freight Frenzy season, this robot was designed to handle diverse game elements—cubes, balls, and ducks—while maximizing scoring efficiency. It combined a mecanum drivetrain with a telescopic intake/outtake system, a carousel spinner, and autonomous programs leveraging vision and odometry for reliable freight delivery.

## Highlights

- Modular intake with flexible tubing, and a 3D‑printed outtake box mounted on a lift
- Iterated through six prototypes, refining mechanisms for intake, lift, and capping
- Built the control stack: RoadRunner trajectories, OpenCV color detection, and encoder‑based lift automation
- Tuned sensors for freight detection and autonomous case recognition, enabling multi‑cycle autonomous routines and consistent parking
