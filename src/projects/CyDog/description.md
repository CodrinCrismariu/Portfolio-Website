CyDog was my first attempt at a robotic dog: a lightweight 3d printed body with linkages driving each leg. I paired those linkages with inverse kinematics code to experiment with foot placement and control.

## Highlights

- Budget servos struggled under load, so CyDog could only shuffle before overheatingâ€”proof we needed more torque.
- The inverse kinematics laid the groundwork for later quadrupeds, even if this frame never achieved a stable walk.
- The project taught me how to translate Fusion 360 concepts into working mechanics, setting the stage for more capable dogs.
