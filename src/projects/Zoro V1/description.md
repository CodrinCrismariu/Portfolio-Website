Zoro V1 is a prototype designed to function as an autonomous robotic dog equipped with two main systems: a robotic dog mechanism and a localization system. Its primary purpose is to operate in hazardous or inaccessible environments, such as power plants, laboratories, or contaminated areas, to monitor activities safely without human intervention.

## What stuck

- Visual odometry using custom made stereo camera pair and an onboard Intel NUC running ORB-SLAM
- Force transfer using linkages from knee joint to servomotor on the body
- Inverse kinematics control
- Visual interface for monitoring and control.
