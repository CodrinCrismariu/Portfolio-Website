We are building Tufts University&apos;s first solar race car with the goal of competing in the World Solar Challenge. I am leading the dynamics lead and working to design a new rollcage and adjustable roof, while also testing the manufactured suspension and steering systems.

## Current focus

- Designed the steering system using CNC-machined aluminum and a custom infused carbon fiber steering wheel
- Lead a ten-person structures team developing the steel-welded roll cage and an adjustable roof angling mechanism that maximizes array yield while the car is stationary.
- Designed FEA simulations to ensure the structural integrity of the vehicle subsystems
