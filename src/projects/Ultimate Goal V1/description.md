Ultimate Goal V1 was the first prototype robot for the First Tech Challenge Ultimate Goal season that taught me how to CAD, 3D print, lasercut to finally launch foam rings at a target

## Highlights

- Spinning compliant wheels to pull the rings inside the robot storage
- Flywheel spinning at 6000 RPM to launch foam rings
- Dead wheel odometry for autonomous localization and pathing
