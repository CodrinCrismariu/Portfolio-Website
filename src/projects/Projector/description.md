This hologram projector is a swept-surface volumetric display that paints mid-air imagery using persistence of vision. A research sample DLP LightCrafter 3000 throws 4 kHz frames onto a rapidly translating sheet, letting each slit of light stack into full 3D voxels that hang in space.

## Highlights

- The LightCrafter 3000 engine drives a light field at a very high refresh rate
- The presitance of vision makes it seem like there is a 3d object mid-air made of multiple 2d projections
- a microcontroller re-times the display sweeps so holograms stay aligned with the physical demo
