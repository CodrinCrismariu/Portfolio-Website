A fully autonomous, 3D-printed quadruped built for ISEF to map and navigate its surroundings. Hardware includes a modified Xbox Kinect for RGB‑D mapping, joint encoders for proprioception, high‑torque servos, and an Intel NUC for onboard mapping and localization. I researched robot control theory, gait dynamics, and inverse kinematics, and designed all mechanical components in Fusion 360.

### Highlights

- RGB‑D mapping using a modified Xbox Kinect and RGBD-SLAM in ROS
- Encoder-based proprioception and closed-loop joint control with high-torque servos.
- Onboard Intel NUC running mapping and localization stacks.
- Researched gait dynamics, inverse kinematics, and motion planning.
