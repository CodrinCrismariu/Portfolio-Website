Built for the 2022–2023 FTC Power Play season, this robot focused on cycling cones as fast as possible It paired a compact mecanum drivetrain with a virtual four-bar arm, automated assists, and consistent five-cone autonomous routines that helped us reach top 10 OPR(offensive-power-rating) in the world.

## Highlights

- Led the CAD team in designing a custom mecanum chassis, V4B arm, modular Misumi elevator and custom silicone claws.
- Iterative design process to optimize every part of the robot finally voted 2nd in the world
- Built the control stack: pure‑pursuit autos, dual dead-wheel odometry, and FSM-driven driver macros.
- Tuned color and distance sensors for auto-align, scoring, and recovery after impacts.
