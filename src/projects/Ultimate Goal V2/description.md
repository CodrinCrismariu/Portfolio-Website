This was the updated version of the Ultimate Goal robot with a new intake, elevator storage and yaw changing launcher, shooting foam rings at a target.

## Upgrade notes

- Spinning compliant wheels to pull the rings inside the robot storage with an added counteroller to help from lifting rings off the ground
- Flywheel spinning at 6000 RPM with an aditional wheel to cancel backspin
- 3D printed bearing to adjust the angle of the launcher based on orientation
- Dead wheel odometry for autonomous localization and pathing
